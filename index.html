      <h1>Abstract</h1>

      <p>
        Food deserts are areas with limited access to
        affordable and nutritious food, most prevalent in
        the Midwest and Southern United States. People
        living in food deserts don’t have easy access to
        supermarkets and must often rely on fast food
        restaurants and frozen foods. They often develop
        long-term health problems as a result, like heart
        conditions, obesity, and diabetes. Visualizations
        can help find areas that are food deserts,
        particularly maps to visually identify areas that
        don’t have easy access to grocery stores and fresh
        food and the severity of health conditions in
        certain areas. Our project aims to help government
        officials or food environment researchers
        determine which areas are severe food deserts and
        need more aid, perhaps from the government.

      <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

      <p>
        Our visualization above is intended for an employee of the Office of Food Access who wants to know which areas have the lowest food access to healthy food, so they can determine where to place new Summer Eats locations for public schools. They can pinch to zoom into the map and view counties as well as hover to see a tooltip with the county and state name. The counties with varying hues display where on the spectrum of low access they are. Comparison of counties can be done by first selecting up to 3 desired counties from the map or search bars. After picking the counties, they see the breakdown of the demographics, specifically race, for low food access percentages. The display of the demographics supports the task to educate community members on the impacts of food insecurity so that they understand the importance of the Summer Eats program. Seeing that there is a correlation between low food access and race, the user can create educational content to support the need of this meal program. In order to understand the health concerns around low food access, the user needs to look at the coordinated graph below the map, which displays the diabetes and obesity rates compared to the percentage of population with low access to grocery stores. This graph displays both diabetes and obesity rate through different channels. The user sees the difference between the two colors and notices that the counties added to the list they viewed earlier are also the ones displayed on the graph. This helps see more information about counties and separate their tasks. They can fulfill their task of informing school districts that need more funding for their free lunch programs. Often, healthier options for meals cost more, so seeing the food insecurity impact on health can benefit the allocation of resources to school districts.
